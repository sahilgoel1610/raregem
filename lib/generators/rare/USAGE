Description:
    This generates a file in onetimer folder with a timestamp as suffix.
    Inside this file there is a method "run_once" which would be run once per developer.
    Make sure you enter all your code inside this run_once function. Treat this as your "main" function.

Example:
    rails generate onetimer Thing

    This will create:
        Thing201511118888.rb
